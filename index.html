				<h2>Who We Are</h2>
			</section>
			<section class="expandedsection">
				<p>What started as a humble Facebook group has now evolved into something so much more.</p>
				<p>Created in May 2022 by Jason Reynolds, the International Blind Cafe (or IBC) boasts a thriving B/VI community of over 1,600 members across the world.</p>
				<p>With members from Canada, the US, the UK, South Africa, Australia, and numerous other nations, the IBC is an open and inviting space for people of all adult ages, backgrounds, lifestyles, livelihoods, beliefs, and cultures.</p>
				<p>As long as you are blind, visually impaired, or know someone with a vision impairment, you have a seat at our table. </p>
				<p>The drinks may cost, but the conversations are priceless.</p>

				<h2>What We Offer</h2>
			</section>
			<section class="expandedsection">
				<p>The IBC has a wide array of activities to offer its members.</p>
				<p>We hold various events, game nights, volunteer-led Braille study groups, and more in our Discord server.</p>
				<p>Our Discord features an active voice chat community, with open rooms that function like having a seat at a digital bar.</p>
				<p>While we are an 18+ community, this is not a dating-centric environment. We're here to have a good time, while still respecting everyone's space.</p>
				<p>We also recently have concluded the first season of our women-led podcast, "The Cauldron", and are also in the midst of the first season of the men's podcast, "Booth 6".</p>
				<p>Both podcasts are available for listening on our Spotify page, and you can also catch them (and additional IBC content) on our YouTube channel.</p>
